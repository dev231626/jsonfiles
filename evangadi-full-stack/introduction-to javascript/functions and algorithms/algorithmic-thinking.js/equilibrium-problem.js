// lets say there is an array and we want to find the equilibrium position where the sum of the right and left is equal not including the position number where the equilibrium rests so define a function that sums the right and left continuisly until it finds equilibrium or retuns -1 if there is no equi in array.


 [2,3,4,7,5,4] // first begin from the number one which is 3 to

var e = 1;




e = 1;
left = 2;// add up everything in left of e
right = 2; // add up everything in a right of e
// compare the two
// if they are equal , then e is equilibrium return e.
// if not, increase e by one.
// do the same until e is array.lenght - 2. 
// if left and right are equal at some point return e.
// if e gets to array.length - 2 before left and right are equal 

// return -1
