//  conditional-statement.....
// conditional-statements are set of rules performed if a certain condition is net.

// there are 3 types of conditional statements...   

// 1. the evaluation
// - this is where you analyze values in your script to determine whether or not they match expected result.

// Ex. var a = 82;  (a <= 55)

// 2. the decision
// - using the results of the evaluation, you decide which path to take
// this is always a true or false value in conditional statements. 
// ex. evaluation
// var a = 32;
// (a <= 55)
// decision: true

// 3. the statement 
// - what to do when conditions are fulfilled or not fulfilled
// Ex; console.log("raise your hand");
// console.log("you failed");  

  
if (a > b){
    console.log(yeah)
}
